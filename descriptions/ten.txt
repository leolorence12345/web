DESCRIPTION:<br>
To take advantage of the orientation of classrooms and corridors according to the sun's position in the implementation of biophilic design, it is necessary to consider various aspects and apply different strategies. Below are some ways to achieve this:
<br><br>

1. Location and design of windows: To harness natural light, it is essential to position windows on the south-facing facades (in the northern hemisphere) or the north-facing facades (in the southern hemisphere) as these will receive more sunlight throughout the day. Designing large and well-distributed windows in classrooms and corridors allows natural light to penetrate the interior, creating brighter and more pleasant spaces.
<br><br>

2. Light and shade control: In addition to placing windows strategically, it is important to consider light and shade control systems. This may include the use of curtains or blinds to regulate the amount of light entering, especially during periods of intense sunlight. Architectural elements such as cantilevers or awnings can also be incorporated to provide shade in outdoor areas or windows exposed to direct sunlight.
<br><br>

3. Integration of green spaces: To make the most of the location of classrooms and corridors near outdoor areas, gardens or courtyards can be designed around educational spaces. These green spaces offer relaxing views and direct connection with nature, contributing to occupants' well-being and fostering a conducive environment for learning or work.
<br><br>

4. Use of natural materials: In the construction and interior design of classrooms and corridors, natural materials like wood, stone, clay, and bamboo can be utilized. These materials not only provide a sense of warmth and authenticity but also help regulate humidity and temperature, thereby improving indoor air quality and occupant comfort.
