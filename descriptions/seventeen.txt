What do I wonder?
*How does the Biophilic Design influence the fact that the Metropolitan University of Toronto campus is located in the heart of downtown and within a fully urban context?


*How can we find Biophilic Design on the campus, and how is it expressed? What is its importance in learning environments?


*Where should the hallways be oriented, and what about the classrooms and common areas?
